module Freemium
  ## Adds 'manual billing' functionality to the Subscription class. Manual
  ## billing means that you are not using 'recurring billing' functionality
  ## of your payment processor. Instead you will run the 'run_billing' method
  ## each day, and freemium will make sure accounts get charged appropriately.
  ## You can call 'run_billing' from a cron job with this command:
  ## /PATH/TO/DEPLOYED/APP/script/runner -e production FreemiumSubscription.run_billing

  ## JCS: I'm not sure what's up with the instance variables in here. Maybe they should be local variables?
